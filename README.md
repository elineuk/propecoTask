## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a simple application built with a React Based Framework (Next.JS) that allows the user to input a reference number (UPRN) and calls the associated API and returns the data in a JSON Tree Viewer.

## THINGS I WOULD ADD IF GIVEN THE TIME

I would of probably updated the presentation to use a table structure, keeping the collapsable rows but presenting it in a bigger format, filling the page and making it look more digestiable to the average customer.

## ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
